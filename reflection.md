Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Which methods did you decide to `overload`, and why?
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
I overloaded the constructors for each class since they had enough parameters and it made sense to me that a user may not know all the specifications they want for their building all the time. 
I couldn't find a way to make showOptions() print for the building classes, but otherwise just paying attention to my notes on the differences between overloading and overriding made this assignment fun to work through without any huge roadblocks that took up my time.
